 Problem Statement
 
 An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.
 
 Declaration:
 
 int arr[10]; //Declares an array named arr of size 10, i.e; you can store 10 integers.
 Accessing elements of an array:
 
 Indexing in arrays starts from 0.So the first element is stored at arr[0],the second element at arr[1]...arr[9]
 You'll be an given array of N integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.
 
 Input Format
 
 The first line of the input contains N,where N is the number of integers.The next line contains N integers separated by a space.
 
 Constraints
 
 1<=N<=1000
 1<=Ai<=10000, where Ai is the ith integer in the array.
 
 Output Format
 
 Print the N integers of the array in the reverse order in a single line separated by a space.
 
 Sample Input
 
 4
 1 4 3 2
 Sample Output
 
 2 3 4 1
